# 📄 RecoveryOS_Roadmap.md

### ✅ Current State
- **Python Environment:** Python 3.13.7 (in `.venv`)  
- **Editor:** VS Code configured as primary editor  
- **Workflows:** `preflight.yml`, `docker-build.yml`, `comprehensive-ci.yml`  
- **CI/CD:** Preflight failing (isort vs black conflict), Docker build failing, GITHUB_TOKEN perms still blocking security scans  
- **Devin:** Cannot fully run due to missing `scripts/bootstrap_devin.sh`  

### 🛠 Fixes Completed
- [x] Added alias for `PYTHONPATH`  
- [x] Integrated multi-stage Dockerfile (Python 3.11 → upgraded path)  
- [x] Implemented `SecurityHeadersMiddleware` + 8 tests (passing)  
- [x] Docker runs as non-root + healthcheck confirmed  
- [x] Added OpenAI smoketest script & token usage reporting (#11 approved)  
- [x] CSP env middleware + integration tests enabled (#14 approved)  
- [x] Elite AI endpoints + comprehensive test infra (#16 approved)  

### 🚨 Current Problems
- ❌ PR #10: `style: satisfy CI code-quality (ruff + black)` → failing  
- ❌ PR #5: `Comprehensive Security Hardening: ASGI Middleware + Docker Multi-Stage Build` → failing  
- ❌ PR #23: `chore(legal): add MIT LICENSE and third-party license inventory` → pending review  
- GITHUB_TOKEN still not granting correct perms for scans  
- Preflight jobs inconsistent with local `black`/`ruff` checks  

### 📌 Open PRs (as of Aug 29, 2025)
- #23: MIT LICENSE + legal inventory ❌ needs review  
- #16: Elite AI endpoints + test infra ✅ merged-ready  
- #14: CSP env middleware ✅ merged-ready  
- #11: OpenAI smoketest + token usage ✅ merged-ready  
- #10: Style/CI code-quality ❌ failing  
- #5: Security Hardening + Docker ❌ failing  

### 📌 Next Action Items
1. Resolve formatter conflict: decide whether **black** or **isort/ruff** rules dominate (to unblock PR #10).  
2. Fix Docker build issues in PR #5 → unify Python 3.11 vs 3.13 approach.  
3. Review and approve legal/license PR (#23).  
4. Correct GitHub Actions permissions → ensure GITHUB_TOKEN covers security scans.  
5. Restore or replace missing `scripts/bootstrap_devin.sh` → needed for Devin startup.  
6. Merge approved PRs (#11, #14, #16) into integration branch once blockers resolved.
